# Capstone
A space to share my experience in creating my final project @ GA working with a react frontend and django backend to create MyCarGarage App
## My Car Garage: A Car Repair Log App
### The App: 
Tired of trying to figure out when you changed your oil last? Or the last time you rotated the tires on your SUV? My Car Garage App saves things like services for or notes for a specific vehicle in your “garage”. Oil changes, and maybe even receipts & important document you need to have backed up can all be stored in one place and accessed easily.
### Technologies: 
React will be used to run Frontend, Django and Postgres to run the backend and database. Heroku to deploy the app live.
